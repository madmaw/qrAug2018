# Qantas React Exercise

These instructions assume you already have NPM/Node installed

## Server
Note: Running the server will also run the latest client build
1. Navigate to `projectdir/client`
2. `npm install` (you need this to get the non-webpacked react libraries)
3. Navigate to `projectdir/server`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`
6. Open your favorite web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`
7. Any changes you make to the server code (but not the client code) will be applied immediately

## Building the client
1. Navigate to `projectdir/client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. Refresh your browser (launched above) to see the client changes

## Running the client dev server
1. Run the server as per the above instructions
2. Navigate to `projectdir/client`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run serve`
5. Open your favorite web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`
6. Any changes you make to the client code will be applied immediately
